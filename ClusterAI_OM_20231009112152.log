**task_prompt**: 1. Use pandas to read the excel file at /home/oliver/ChatDev/tools_data.xlsx
2. the first three columns are Task Name, Name, Link. Discard other columns.
3. Name the pandas object 'Data_pd' and sav it to file 'Data_pd.parquet'
4. Use the Sentence Transformers package and the "BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5" model to get embeddings of the 'Task Name' column from the pandas . This model is already available to you in the environment. 
5. Add the embeddings column to the pandas dataframe 'Data_pd', now we have columns for Link, Task Name and Embedding. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'.
6. Cluster those embeddings using 20 clusters in K-means. 
7. Update the pandas dataframe 'Data_pd' with each row's cluster assignment. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'.
8. Now that you have clusters, use Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to reduce the embedding dimensions 2. Save those 'reduced_embeddings' to pandas 'Data_pd'. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'.
9. Display a plotly scatter of the 'reduced embeddings'. Remember to use a list comprehension to extract the x and y value from each vector in the 'reduced embedding' column. Also, color=cluster label.
10. Find the centroid of each cluster. Creat a new pandas dataframe 'Clusters_pd', one row per cluster label. Add cluster centroids to the pandas dataframe 'Clusters_pd'. Save 'Clusters_pd' to file 'Cluster_pd.parquet'.
11. Find the 10 embeddings closest to each cluster's centroid, use the two pandas dataframes; 'Data_pd' for embeddings and 'Cluster_pd' for embedding centroids. This will require creating a new pandas dataframe, 'Closest_pd'. Save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'.
12. Create lists of the 'Task Name' for each batch of those 10 embeddings, each batch representing one cluster. Add these to 'Closest_pd'. Hint: as you add 10 'Task Names' for each cluster to 'Closest_pd', use the pd.concat() function to append to 'Closest_pd'. Finally, save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'.
13. Create a prompt for OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo and, for each cluster in 'Closest_pd', submit the list of 10 'Task Names' to the model and ask the model for a summary in 8 words. Repeat this for each cluster. The model will return a 'Task Name summary', one for each cluster.  Record these in the pandas dataframe 'Cluster_pd'. Save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'. Save 'Cluster_pd' to file 'Cluster_pd.parquet'.
14. Display a table of 'Cluster_pd'; 'Cluster label', 'Task Name summary', 'reduced_embedding' and merge the dataframe with a count of records per cluster from 'Data_pd'.
15. Using 'Cluster_pd', Display a plotly scatter of the cluster centroids labelled with 'Task Name summary'. As before, remember to use a list comprehensions to access the x and y value in each centroid vector.

Modality: "application".

Ideas: "".

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

9. Display a plotly scatter of the 'reduced embeddings'. Remember to use a list comprehension to extract the x and y value from each vector in the 'reduced embedding' column. Also, color=cluster label.
10. Find the centroid of each cluster. Creat a new pandas dataframe 'Clusters_pd', one row per cluster label. Add cluster centroids to the pandas dataframe 'Clusters_pd'. Save 'Clusters_pd' to file 'Cluster_pd.parquet'.
11. Find the 10 embeddings closest to each cluster's centroid, use the two pandas dataframes; 'Data_pd' for embeddings and 'Cluster_pd' for embedding centroids. This will require creating a new pandas dataframe, 'Closest_pd'. Save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'.
12. Create lists of the 'Task Name' for each batch of those 10 embeddings, each batch representing one cluster. Add these to 'Closest_pd'. Hint: as you add 10 'Task Names' for each cluster to 'Closest_pd', use the pd.concat() function to append to 'Closest_pd'. Finally, save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'.
13. Create a prompt for OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo and, for each cluster in 'Closest_pd', submit the list of 10 'Task Names' to the model and ask the model for a summary in 8 words.

You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: 1. Use pandas to read the excel file at /home/oliver/ChatDev/tools_data.xlsx
2. the first three columns are Task Name, Name, Link. Discard other columns.
3. Name the pandas object 'Data_pd' and sav it to file 'Data_pd.parquet'
4. Use the Sentence Transformers package and the "BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5" model to get embeddings of the 'Task Name' column from the pandas . This model is already available to you in the environment. 
5. Add the embeddings column to the pandas dataframe 'Data_pd', now we have columns for Link, Task Name and Embedding. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'.
6. Cluster those embeddings using 20 clusters in K-means. 
7. Update the pandas dataframe 'Data_pd' with each row's cluster assignment. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'.
8. Now that you have clusters, use Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to reduce the embedding dimensions 2. Save those 'reduced_embeddings' to pandas 'Data_pd'. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'.
9. Display a plotly scatter of the 'reduced embeddings'. Remember to use a list comprehension to extract the x and y value from each vector in the 'reduced embedding' column. Also, color=cluster label.
10. Find the centroid of each cluster. Creat a new pandas dataframe 'Clusters_pd', one row per cluster label. Add cluster centroids to the pandas dataframe 'Clusters_pd'. Save 'Clusters_pd' to file 'Cluster_pd.parquet'.
11. Find the 10 embeddings closest to each cluster's centroid, use the two pandas dataframes; 'Data_pd' for embeddings and 'Cluster_pd' for embedding centroids. This will require creating a new pandas dataframe, 'Closest_pd'. Save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'.
12. Create lists of the 'Task Name' for each batch of those 10 embeddings, each batch representing one cluster. Add these to 'Closest_pd'. Hint: as you add 10 'Task Names' for each cluster to 'Closest_pd', use the pd.concat() function to append to 'Closest_pd'. Finally, save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'.
13. Create a prompt for OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo and, for each cluster in 'Closest_pd', submit the list of 10 'Task Names' to the model and ask the model for a summary in 8 words. Repeat this for each cluster. The model will return a 'Task Name summary', one for each cluster.  Record these in the pandas dataframe 'Cluster_pd'. Save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'. Save 'Cluster_pd' to file 'Cluster_pd.parquet'.
14. Display a table of 'Cluster_pd'; 'Cluster label', 'Task Name summary', 'reduced_embedding' and merge the dataframe with a count of records per cluster from 'Data_pd'.
15. Using 'Cluster_pd', Display a plotly scatter of the cluster centroids labelled with 'Task Name summary'. As before, remember to use a list comprehensions to access the x and y value in each centroid vector..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

[2023-09-10 11:25:23 INFO] Programmer: **Programmer<->Chief Technology Officer on : Coding, turn 0**

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: 1. Use pandas to read the excel file at /home/oliver/ChatDev/tools_data.xlsx
2. the first three columns are Task Name, Name, Link. Discard other columns.
3. Name the pandas object 'Data_pd' and sav it to file 'Data_pd.parquet'
4. Use the Sentence Transformers package and the "BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5" model to get embeddings of the 'Task Name' column from the pandas . This model is already available to you in the environment. 
5. Add the embeddings column to the pandas dataframe 'Data_pd', now we have columns for Link, Task Name and Embedding. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'.
6. Cluster those embeddings using 20 clusters in K-means. 
7. Update the pandas dataframe 'Data_pd' with each row's cluster assignment. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'.
8. Now that you have clusters, use Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to reduce the embedding dimensions 2. Save those 'reduced_embeddings' to pandas 'Data_pd'. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'.
9. Display a plotly scatter of the 'reduced embeddings'. Remember to use a list comprehension to extract the x and y value from each vector in the 'reduced embedding' column. Also, color=cluster label.
10. Find the centroid of each cluster. Creat a new pandas dataframe 'Clusters_pd', one row per cluster label. Add cluster centroids to the pandas dataframe 'Clusters_pd'. Save 'Clusters_pd' to file 'Cluster_pd.parquet'.
11. Find the 10 embeddings closest to each cluster's centroid, use the two pandas dataframes; 'Data_pd' for embeddings and 'Cluster_pd' for embedding centroids. This will require creating a new pandas dataframe, 'Closest_pd'. Save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'.
12. Create lists of the 'Task Name' for each batch of those 10 embeddings, each batch representing one cluster. Add these to 'Closest_pd'. Hint: as you add 10 'Task Names' for each cluster to 'Closest_pd', use the pd.concat() function to append to 'Closest_pd'. Finally, save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'.
13. Create a prompt for OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo and, for each cluster in 'Closest_pd', submit the list of 10 'Task Names' to the model and ask the model for a summary in 8 words. Repeat this for each cluster. The model will return a 'Task Name summary', one for each cluster.  Record these in the pandas dataframe 'Cluster_pd'. Save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'. Save 'Cluster_pd' to file 'Cluster_pd.parquet'.
14. Display a table of 'Cluster_pd'; 'Cluster label', 'Task Name summary', 'reduced_embedding' and merge the dataframe with a count of records per cluster from 'Data_pd'.
15. Using 'Cluster_pd', Display a plotly scatter of the cluster centroids labelled with 'Task Name summary'. As before, remember to use a list comprehensions to access the x and y value in each centroid vector..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Sure, I will provide a high-level overview of the Python scripts needed to accomplish the tasks. Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `read_excel_file`: This function will use pandas to read the excel file and return a dataframe.
2. `discard_columns`: This function will discard unnecessary columns from the dataframe.
3. `get_embeddings`: This function will use the Sentence Transformers package to get embeddings of the 'Task Name' column.
4. `cluster_embeddings`: This function will use K-means to cluster the embeddings.
5. `reduce_dimensions`: This function will use Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to reduce the embedding dimensions.
6. `plot_embeddings`: This function will use plotly to display a scatter plot of the reduced embeddings.
7. `find_centroids`: This function will find the centroid of each cluster.
8. `find_closest_embeddings`: This function will find the 10 embeddings closest to each cluster's centroid.
9. `create_task_lists`: This function will create lists of the 'Task Name' for each batch of those 10 embeddings.
10. `get_task_summary`: This function will use OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo to get a summary of the task names.
11. `display_table`: This function will display a table of 'Cluster_pd'.
12. `plot_centroids`: This function will use plotly to display a scatter plot of the cluster centroids.

Now, let's start with the main file, `main.py`:

main.py

```python

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is a high-level overview of the task and does not include the implementation of the functions that are being called. This is a major issue as the code will not run without these functions. 

Here is a suggestion on how to implement one of the missing functions, `read_excel_file`:

```python
def read_excel_file(file_path):
    """
    This function reads an excel file and returns a pandas dataframe.
    :param file_path: The path to the excel file.
    :return: A pandas dataframe containing the data from the excel file.
    """
    return pd.read_excel(file_path)
```

You should implement the rest of the functions in a similar manner, ensuring that each function performs its intended task and handles any potential errors. For example, the `read_excel_file` function should handle the case where the file does not exist at the provided path. 

Also, remember to save the pandas dataframes 'Data_pd', 'Clusters_pd', and 'Closest_pd' to their respective parquet files as specified in the task. 

Finally, the OpenAI API key is hardcoded in the script. This is a security risk and it's recommended to use environment variables to handle sensitive data like API keys. You can use the `os` module to access environment variables:

```python
import os
openai.api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```

You can set the environment variable in your terminal before running the script:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

Please revise the code according to these suggestions.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided is a high-level overview of the task and does not include the implementation of the functions that are being called. This is a major issue as the code will not run without these functions. 

Here is a suggestion on how to implement one of the missing functions, `read_excel_file`:

```python
def read_excel_file(file_path):
    """
    This function reads an excel file and returns a pandas dataframe.
    :param file_path: The path to the excel file.
    :return: A pandas dataframe containing the data from the excel file.
    """
    return pd.read_excel(file_path)
```

You should implement the rest of the functions in a similar manner, ensuring that each function performs its intended task and handles any potential errors. For example, the `read_excel_file` function should handle the case where the file does not exist at the provided path. 

Also, remember to save the pandas dataframes 'Data_pd', 'Clusters_pd', and 'Closest_pd' to their respective parquet files as specified in the task. 

Finally, the OpenAI API key is hardcoded in the script. This is a security risk and it's recommended to use environment variables to handle sensitive data like API keys. You can use the `os` module to access environment variables:

```python
import os
openai.api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```

You can set the environment variable in your terminal before running the script:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

Please revise the code according to these suggestions."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments.

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **task_prompt** |  Use pandas to read the excel file at /home/oliver/ChatDev/tools_data.xlsx the first three columns are Task Name, Name, Link. Discard other columns. Name the pandas object 'Data_pd' and sav it to file 'Data_pd.parquet' Use the Sentence Transformers package and the "BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5" model to get embeddings of the 'Task Name' column from the pandas . This model is already available to you in the environment.  Add the embeddings column to the pandas dataframe 'Data_pd', now we have columns for Link, Task Name and Embedding. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'. Cluster those embeddings using 20 clusters in K-means.  Update the pandas dataframe 'Data_pd' with each row's cluster assignment. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'. Now that you have clusters, use Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to reduce the embedding dimensions 2. Save those 'reduced_embeddings' to pandas 'Data_pd'. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'. Display a plotly scatter of the 'reduced embeddings'. Remember to use a list comprehension to extract the x and y value from each vector in the 'reduced embedding' column. Also, color=cluster label. Find the centroid of each cluster. Creat a new pandas dataframe 'Clusters_pd', one row per cluster label. Add cluster centroids to the pandas dataframe 'Clusters_pd'. Save 'Clusters_pd' to file 'Cluster_pd.parquet'. Find the 10 embeddings closest to each cluster's centroid, use the two pandas dataframes; 'Data_pd' for embeddings and 'Cluster_pd' for embedding centroids. This will require creating a new pandas dataframe, 'Closest_pd'. Save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'. Create lists of the 'Task Name' for each batch of those 10 embeddings, each batch representing one cluster. Add these to 'Closest_pd'. Hint: as you add 10 'Task Names' for each cluster to 'Closest_pd', use the pd.concat() function to append to 'Closest_pd'. Finally, save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'. Create a prompt for OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo and, for each cluster in 'Closest_pd', submit the list of 10 'Task Names' to the model and ask the model for a summary in 8 words. Repeat this for each cluster. The model will return a 'Task Name summary', one for each cluster.  Record these in the pandas dataframe 'Cluster_pd'. Save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'. Save 'Cluster_pd' to file 'Cluster_pd.parquet'. Display a table of 'Cluster_pd'; 'Cluster label', 'Task Name summary', 'reduced_embedding' and merge the dataframe with a count of records per cluster from 'Data_pd'. Using 'Cluster_pd', Display a plotly scatter of the cluster centroids labelled with 'Task Name summary'. As before, remember to use a list comprehensions to access the x and y value in each centroid vector.  |

8. Now that you have clusters, use Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to reduce the embedding dimensions 2. Save those 'reduced_embeddings' to pandas 'Data_pd'. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'.
9. Display a plotly scatter of the 'reduced embeddings'. Remember to use a list comprehension to extract the x and y value from each vector in the 'reduced embedding' column. Also, color=cluster label.
10. Find the centroid of each cluster. Creat a new pandas dataframe 'Clusters_pd', one row per cluster label. Add cluster centroids to the pandas dataframe 'Clusters_pd'. Save 'Clusters_pd' to file 'Cluster_pd.parquet'.
11. Find the 10 embeddings closest to each cluster's centroid, use the two pandas dataframes; 'Data_pd' for embeddings and 'Cluster_pd' for embedding centroids. This will require creating a new pandas dataframe, 'Closest_pd'. Save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'.
12. Create lists of the 'Task Name' for each batch of those 10 embeddings, each batch representing one cluster. Add these to 'Closest_pd'. Hint: as you add 10 'Task Names' for each cluster to 'Closest_pd', use the pd.concat() function to append to 'Closest_pd'. Finally, save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'.
13. Create a prompt for OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo and, for each cluster in 'Closest_pd', submit the list of 10 'Task Names' to the model and ask the model for a summary in 8 words. Repeat this for each cluster. The model will return a 'Task Name summary', one for each cluster.  Record these in the pandas dataframe 'Cluster_pd'. Save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'. Save 'Cluster_pd' to file 'Cluster_pd.parquet'.
14. Display a table of 'Cluster_pd'; 'Cluster label', 'Task Name summary', 'reduced_embedding' and merge the dataframe with a count of records per cluster from 'Data_pd'.
15. Using 'Cluster_pd', Display a plotly scatter of the cluster centroids labelled with 'Task Name summary'. As before, remember to use a list comprehensions to access the x and y value in each centroid vector..

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: 1. Use pandas to read the excel file at /home/oliver/ChatDev/tools_data.xlsx
2. the first three columns are Task Name, Name, Link. Discard other columns.
3. Name the pandas object 'Data_pd' and sav it to file 'Data_pd.parquet'

5. Add the embeddings column to the pandas dataframe 'Data_pd', now we have columns for Link, Task Name and Embedding. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'.
6. Cluster those embeddings using 20 clusters in K-means. 
7. Update the pandas dataframe 'Data_pd' with each row's cluster assignment. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'.
8. Now that you have clusters, use Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to reduce the embedding dimensions 2. Save those 'reduced_embeddings' to pandas 'Data_pd'. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'.
9. Display a plotly scatter of the 'reduced embeddings'. Remember to use a list comprehension to extract the x and y value from each vector in the 'reduced embedding' column. Also, color=cluster label.
10. Find the centroid of each cluster. Creat a new pandas dataframe 'Clusters_pd', one row per cluster label. Add cluster centroids to the pandas dataframe 'Clusters_pd'. Save 'Clusters_pd' to file 'Cluster_pd.parquet'.
11. Find the 10 embeddings closest to each cluster's centroid, use the two pandas dataframes; 'Data_pd' for embeddings and 'Cluster_pd' for embedding centroids. This will require creating a new pandas dataframe, 'Closest_pd'. Save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'.

The code seems to be well-structured and follows the task requirements closely. However, there is a potential issue with the function `find_closest_embeddings`. The function is supposed to find the 10 embeddings closest to each cluster's centroid, but it seems to only find the single closest embedding to each centroid. 

Here is the current implementation:

```python
def find_closest_embeddings(embeddings, centroids):
    """
    This function finds the 10 embeddings closest to each cluster's centroid.
    :param embeddings: A list of embeddings.
    :param centroids: A list of centroids.
    :return: A pandas dataframe containing the 10 closest embeddings to each centroid.
    """
    closest_pd = pd.DataFrame()
    closest_pd['Embedding'] = embeddings
    closest_pd['Closest'] = [pairwise_distances_argmin_min([centroid], embeddings)[0][0] for centroid in centroids]
    return closest_pd
```

The function `pairwise_distances_argmin_min` returns the index of the minimum distances. However, it only returns the index of the single closest point, not the 10 closest points.

To fix this, you could use the `NearestNeighbors` class from `sklearn.neighbors`. Here is a revised version of the function:

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors

def find_closest_embeddings(embeddings, centroids):
    """
    This function finds the 10 embeddings closest to each cluster's centroid.
    :param embeddings: A list of embeddings.
    :param centroids: A list of centroids.
    :return: A pandas dataframe containing the 10 closest embeddings to each centroid.
    """
    closest_pd = pd.DataFrame()
    closest_pd['Embedding'] = embeddings
    closest_pd['Closest'] = []
    nbrs = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=10, algorithm='ball_tree').fit(embeddings)
    for centroid in centroids:
        distances, indices = nbrs.kneighbors([centroid])
        closest_pd['Closest'].append(indices[0])
    return closest_pd
```

This revised function uses `NearestNeighbors` to find the indices of the 10 closest embeddings to each centroid. It then appends these indices to the 'Closest' column of the dataframe.

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task, our designed product modality, languages and ideas, our developed first-edition source codes are listed below: 
Task: "1. Use pandas to read the excel file at /home/oliver/ChatDev/tools_data.xlsx
2. the first three columns are Task Name, Name, Link. Discard other columns.
3. Name the pandas object 'Data_pd' and sav it to file 'Data_pd.parquet'
4. Use the Sentence Transformers package and the "BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5" model to get embeddings of the 'Task Name' column from the pandas . This model is already available to you in the environment. 
5. Add the embeddings column to the pandas dataframe 'Data_pd', now we have columns for Link, Task Name and Embedding. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'.
6. Cluster those embeddings using 20 clusters in K-means. 
7. Update the pandas dataframe 'Data_pd' with each row's cluster assignment. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'.
8. Now that you have clusters, use Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to reduce the embedding dimensions 2. Save those 'reduced_embeddings' to pandas 'Data_pd'. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'.
9. Display a plotly scatter of the 'reduced embeddings'. Remember to use a list comprehension to extract the x and y value from each vector in the 'reduced embedding' column. Also, color=cluster label.
10. Find the centroid of each cluster. Creat a new pandas dataframe 'Clusters_pd', one row per cluster label. Add cluster centroids to the pandas dataframe 'Clusters_pd'. Save 'Clusters_pd' to file 'Cluster_pd.parquet'.
11. Find the 10 embeddings closest to each cluster's centroid, use the two pandas dataframes; 'Data_pd' for embeddings and 'Cluster_pd' for embedding centroids. This will require creating a new pandas dataframe, 'Closest_pd'. Save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'.
12. Create lists of the 'Task Name' for each batch of those 10 embeddings, each batch representing one cluster. Add these to 'Closest_pd'. Hint: as you add 10 'Task Names' for each cluster to 'Closest_pd', use the pd.concat() function to append to 'Closest_pd'. Finally, save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'.
13. Create a prompt for OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo and, for each cluster in 'Closest_pd', submit the list of 10 'Task Names' to the model and ask the model for a summary in 8 words. Repeat this for each cluster. The model will return a 'Task Name summary', one for each cluster.  Record these in the pandas dataframe 'Cluster_pd'. Save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'. Save 'Cluster_pd' to file 'Cluster_pd.parquet'.
14. Display a table of 'Cluster_pd'; 'Cluster label', 'Task Name summary', 'reduced_embedding' and merge the dataframe with a count of records per cluster from 'Data_pd'.
15. Using 'Cluster_pd', Display a plotly scatter of the cluster centroids labelled with 'Task Name summary'. As before, remember to use a list comprehensions to access the x and y value in each centroid vector.".

Comments on Codes:
"The code seems to be well-structured and follows the task requirements closely. However, there is a potential issue with the function `find_closest_embeddings`. The function is supposed to find the 10 embeddings closest to each cluster's centroid, but it seems to only find the single closest embedding to each centroid. 

Here is the current implementation:

```python
def find_closest_embeddings(embeddings, centroids):
    """
    This function finds the 10 embeddings closest to each cluster's centroid.
    :param embeddings: A list of embeddings.
    :param centroids: A list of centroids.
    :return: A pandas dataframe containing the 10 closest embeddings to each centroid.
    """
    closest_pd = pd.DataFrame()
    closest_pd['Embedding'] = embeddings
    closest_pd['Closest'] = [pairwise_distances_argmin_min([centroid], embeddings)[0][0] for centroid in centroids]
    return closest_pd
```

The function `pairwise_distances_argmin_min` returns the index of the minimum distances. However, it only returns the index of the single closest point, not the 10 closest points.

To fix this, you could use the `NearestNeighbors` class from `sklearn.neighbors`. Here is a revised version of the function:

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors

def find_closest_embeddings(embeddings, centroids):
    """
    This function finds the 10 embeddings closest to each cluster's centroid.
    :param embeddings: A list of embeddings.
    :param centroids: A list of centroids.
    :return: A pandas dataframe containing the 10 closest embeddings to each centroid.
    """
    closest_pd = pd.DataFrame()
    closest_pd['Embedding'] = embeddings
    closest_pd['Closest'] = []
    nbrs = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=10, algorithm='ball_tree').fit(embeddings)
    for centroid in centroids:
        distances, indices = nbrs.kneighbors([centroid])
        closest_pd['Closest'].append(indices[0])
    return closest_pd
```

This revised function uses `NearestNeighbors` to find the indices of the 10 closest embeddings to each centroid. It then appends these indices to the 'Closest' column of the dataframe."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: 1. Use pandas to read the excel file at /home/oliver/ChatDev/tools_data.xlsx
2. the first three columns are Task Name, Name, Link. Discard other columns.
3. Name the pandas object 'Data_pd' and sav it to file 'Data_pd.parquet'
4. Use the Sentence Transformers package and the "BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5" model to get embeddings of the 'Task Name' column from the pandas . This model is already available to you in the environment. 
5. Add the embeddings column to the pandas dataframe 'Data_pd', now we have columns for Link, Task Name and Embedding. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'.
6. Cluster those embeddings using 20 clusters in K-means. 
7. Update the pandas dataframe 'Data_pd' with each row's cluster assignment. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'.
8. Now that you have clusters, use Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to reduce the embedding dimensions 2. Save those 'reduced_embeddings' to pandas 'Data_pd'. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'.
9. Display a plotly scatter of the 'reduced embeddings'. Remember to use a list comprehension to extract the x and y value from each vector in the 'reduced embedding' column. Also, color=cluster label.
10. Find the centroid of each cluster. Creat a new pandas dataframe 'Clusters_pd', one row per cluster label. Add cluster centroids to the pandas dataframe 'Clusters_pd'. Save 'Clusters_pd' to file 'Cluster_pd.parquet'.
11. Find the 10 embeddings closest to each cluster's centroid, use the two pandas dataframes; 'Data_pd' for embeddings and 'Cluster_pd' for embedding centroids. This will require creating a new pandas dataframe, 'Closest_pd'. Save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'.

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **task_prompt** |  Use pandas to read the excel file at /home/oliver/ChatDev/tools_data.xlsx the first three columns are Task Name, Name, Link. Discard other columns. Name the pandas object 'Data_pd' and sav it to file 'Data_pd.parquet' Use the Sentence Transformers package and the "BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5" model to get embeddings of the 'Task Name' column from the pandas . This model is already available to you in the environment.  Add the embeddings column to the pandas dataframe 'Data_pd', now we have columns for Link, Task Name and Embedding. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'. Cluster those embeddings using 20 clusters in K-means.  Update the pandas dataframe 'Data_pd' with each row's cluster assignment. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'. Now that you have clusters, use Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to reduce the embedding dimensions 2. Save those 'reduced_embeddings' to pandas 'Data_pd'. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'. Display a plotly scatter of the 'reduced embeddings'. Remember to use a list comprehension to extract the x and y value from each vector in the 'reduced embedding' column. Also, color=cluster label. Find the centroid of each cluster. Creat a new pandas dataframe 'Clusters_pd', one row per cluster label. Add cluster centroids to the pandas dataframe 'Clusters_pd'. Save 'Clusters_pd' to file 'Cluster_pd.parquet'. Find the 10 embeddings closest to each cluster's centroid, use the two pandas dataframes; 'Data_pd' for embeddings and 'Cluster_pd' for embedding centroids. This will require creating a new pandas dataframe, 'Closest_pd'. Save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'. Create lists of the 'Task Name' for each batch of those 10 embeddings, each batch representing one cluster. Add these to 'Closest_pd'. Hint: as you add 10 'Task Names' for each cluster to 'Closest_pd', use the pd.concat() function to append to 'Closest_pd'. Finally, save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'. Create a prompt for OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo and, for each cluster in 'Closest_pd', submit the list of 10 'Task Names' to the model and ask the model for a summary in 8 words. Repeat this for each cluster. The model will return a 'Task Name summary', one for each cluster.  Record these in the pandas dataframe 'Cluster_pd'. Save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'. Save 'Cluster_pd' to file 'Cluster_pd.parquet'. Display a table of 'Cluster_pd'; 'Cluster label', 'Task Name summary', 'reduced_embedding' and merge the dataframe with a count of records per cluster from 'Data_pd'. Using 'Cluster_pd', Display a plotly scatter of the cluster centroids labelled with 'Task Name summary'. As before, remember to use a list comprehensions to access the x and y value in each centroid vector.  |

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: 1. Use pandas to read the excel file at /home/oliver/ChatDev/tools_data.xlsx
2. the first three columns are Task Name, Name, Link. Discard other columns.
3. Name the pandas object 'Data_pd' and sav it to file 'Data_pd.parquet'
4. Use the Sentence Transformers package and the "BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5" model to get embeddings of the 'Task Name' column from the pandas . This model is already available to you in the environment. 
5. Add the embeddings column to the pandas dataframe 'Data_pd', now we have columns for Link, Task Name and Embedding. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'.
6. Cluster those embeddings using 20 clusters in K-means. 
7. Update the pandas dataframe 'Data_pd' with each row's cluster assignment. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'.
8. Now that you have clusters, use Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to reduce the embedding dimensions 2. Save those 'reduced_embeddings' to pandas 'Data_pd'. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'.
9. Display a plotly scatter of the 'reduced embeddings'. Remember to use a list comprehension to extract the x and y value from each vector in the 'reduced embedding' column. Also, color=cluster label.
10. Find the centroid of each cluster. Creat a new pandas dataframe 'Clusters_pd', one row per cluster label. Add cluster centroids to the pandas dataframe 'Clusters_pd'. Save 'Clusters_pd' to file 'Cluster_pd.parquet'.
11. Find the 10 embeddings closest to each cluster's centroid, use the two pandas dataframes; 'Data_pd' for embeddings and 'Cluster_pd' for embedding centroids. This will require creating a new pandas dataframe, 'Closest_pd'. Save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'.
12. Create lists of the 'Task Name' for each batch of those 10 embeddings, each batch representing one cluster. Add these to 'Closest_pd'. Hint: as you add 10 'Task Names' for each cluster to 'Closest_pd', use the pd.concat() function to append to 'Closest_pd'. Finally, save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'.
13. Create a prompt for OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo and, for each cluster in 'Closest_pd', submit the list of 10 'Task Names' to the model and ask the model for a summary in 8 words. Repeat this for each cluster. The model will return a 'Task Name summary', one for each cluster.  Record these in the pandas dataframe 'Cluster_pd'. Save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'. Save 'Cluster_pd' to file 'Cluster_pd.parquet'.
14. Display a table of 'Cluster_pd'; 'Cluster label', 'Task Name summary', 'reduced_embedding' and merge the dataframe with a count of records per cluster from 'Data_pd'.
15. Using 'Cluster_pd', Display a plotly scatter of the cluster centroids labelled with 'Task Name summary'. As before, remember to use a list comprehensions to access the x and y value in each centroid vector..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code seems well-structured and follows good coding practices. However, there is a potential issue in the `find_closest_embeddings` function. The function is supposed to find the 10 embeddings closest to each cluster's centroid, but it seems to be finding the 10 closest embeddings to each embedding, not each centroid.

Here is the problematic part:

```python
nbrs = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=10, algorithm='ball_tree').fit(embeddings)
for centroid in centroids:
    distances, indices = nbrs.kneighbors([centroid])
    closest_pd['Closest'].append(indices[0])
```

The `nbrs.kneighbors([centroid])` will return the indices of the 10 closest neighbors to the centroid in the training data, which is the embeddings. But these indices are then directly appended to the 'Closest' column of the `closest_pd` DataFrame. This means that the 'Closest' column will contain the indices of the embeddings, not the embeddings themselves.

To fix this, you should replace the indices with the corresponding embeddings. Here is the corrected code:

```python
nbrs = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=10, algorithm='ball_tree').fit(embeddings)
for centroid in centroids:
    distances, indices = nbrs.kneighbors([centroid])
    closest_embeddings = [embeddings[i] for i in indices[0]]
    closest_pd['Closest'].append(closest_embeddings)
```

This way, the 'Closest' column of the `closest_pd` DataFrame will contain the 10 embeddings closest to each centroid, as required by the task.

Comments on Codes:
"The code seems well-structured and follows good coding practices. However, there is a potential issue in the `find_closest_embeddings` function. The function is supposed to find the 10 embeddings closest to each cluster's centroid, but it seems to be finding the 10 closest embeddings to each embedding, not each centroid.

Here is the problematic part:

```python
nbrs = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=10, algorithm='ball_tree').fit(embeddings)
for centroid in centroids:
    distances, indices = nbrs.kneighbors([centroid])
    closest_pd['Closest'].append(indices[0])
```

The `nbrs.kneighbors([centroid])` will return the indices of the 10 closest neighbors to the centroid in the training data, which is the embeddings. But these indices are then directly appended to the 'Closest' column of the `closest_pd` DataFrame. This means that the 'Closest' column will contain the indices of the embeddings, not the embeddings themselves.

To fix this, you should replace the indices with the corresponding embeddings. Here is the corrected code:

```python
nbrs = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=10, algorithm='ball_tree').fit(embeddings)
for centroid in centroids:
    distances, indices = nbrs.kneighbors([centroid])
    closest_embeddings = [embeddings[i] for i in indices[0]]
    closest_pd['Closest'].append(closest_embeddings)
```

This way, the 'Closest' column of the `closest_pd` DataFrame will contain the 10 embeddings closest to each centroid, as required by the task."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[2023-09-10 11:44:23 INFO] Programmer: **Programmer<->Code Reviewer on : CodeReviewModification, turn 0**

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: 1. Use pandas to read the excel file at /home/oliver/ChatDev/tools_data.xlsx
2. the first three columns are Task Name, Name, Link. Discard other columns.
3. Name the pandas object 'Data_pd' and sav it to file 'Data_pd.parquet'
4. Use the Sentence Transformers package and the "BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5" model to get embeddings of the 'Task Name' column from the pandas . This model is already available to you in the environment. 
5. Add the embeddings column to the pandas dataframe 'Data_pd', now we have columns for Link, Task Name and Embedding. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'.
6. Cluster those embeddings using 20 clusters in K-means. 
7. Update the pandas dataframe 'Data_pd' with each row's cluster assignment. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'.
8. Now that you have clusters, use Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to reduce the embedding dimensions 2. Save those 'reduced_embeddings' to pandas 'Data_pd'. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'.
9. Display a plotly scatter of the 'reduced embeddings'. Remember to use a list comprehension to extract the x and y value from each vector in the 'reduced embedding' column. Also, color=cluster label.
10. Find the centroid of each cluster. Creat a new pandas dataframe 'Clusters_pd', one row per cluster label. Add cluster centroids to the pandas dataframe 'Clusters_pd'. Save 'Clusters_pd' to file 'Cluster_pd.parquet'.
11. Find the 10 embeddings closest to each cluster's centroid, use the two pandas dataframes; 'Data_pd' for embeddings and 'Cluster_pd' for embedding centroids. This will require creating a new pandas dataframe, 'Closest_pd'. Save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'.
12. Create lists of the 'Task Name' for each batch of those 10 embeddings, each batch representing one cluster. Add these to 'Closest_pd'. Hint: as you add 10 'Task Names' for each cluster to 'Closest_pd', use the pd.concat() function to append to 'Closest_pd'. Finally, save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'.
13. Create a prompt for OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo and, for each cluster in 'Closest_pd', submit the list of 10 'Task Names' to the model and ask the model for a summary in 8 words. Repeat this for each cluster. The model will return a 'Task Name summary', one for each cluster.  Record these in the pandas dataframe 'Cluster_pd'. Save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'. Save 'Cluster_pd' to file 'Cluster_pd.parquet'.
14. Display a table of 'Cluster_pd'; 'Cluster label', 'Task Name summary', 'reduced_embedding' and merge the dataframe with a count of records per cluster from 'Data_pd'.
15. Using 'Cluster_pd', Display a plotly scatter of the cluster centroids labelled with 'Task Name summary'. As before, remember to use a list comprehensions to access the x and y value in each centroid vector..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'. Cluster those embeddings using 20 clusters in K-means.  Update the pandas dataframe 'Data_pd' with each row's cluster assignment. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'. Now that you have clusters, use Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to reduce the embedding dimensions 2. Save those 'reduced_embeddings' to pandas 'Data_pd'. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'. Display a plotly scatter of the 'reduced embeddings'. Remember to use a list comprehension to extract the x and y value from each vector in the 'reduced embedding' column. Also, color=cluster label. Find the centroid of each cluster. Creat a new pandas dataframe 'Clusters_pd', one row per cluster label. Add cluster centroids to the pandas dataframe 'Clusters_pd'. Save 'Clusters_pd' to file 'Cluster_pd.parquet'. Find the 10 embeddings closest to each cluster's centroid, use the two pandas dataframes; 'Data_pd' for embeddings and 'Cluster_pd' for embedding centroids. This will require creating a new pandas dataframe, 'Closest_pd'. Save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'. Create lists of the 'Task Name' for each batch of those 10 embeddings, each batch representing one cluster. Add these to 'Closest_pd'. Hint: as you add 10 'Task Names' for each cluster to 'Closest_pd', use the pd.concat() function to append to 'Closest_pd'. Finally, save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'. Create a prompt for OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo and, for each cluster in 'Closest_pd', submit the list of 10 'Task Names' to the model and ask the model for a summary in 8 words. Repeat this for each cluster. The model will return a 'Task Name summary', one for each cluster.  Record these in the pandas dataframe 'Cluster_pd'. Save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'. Save 'Cluster_pd' to file 'Cluster_pd.parquet'. Display a table of 'Cluster_pd'; 'Cluster label', 'Task Name summary', 'reduced_embedding' and merge the dataframe with a count of records per cluster from 'Data_pd'. Using 'Cluster_pd', Display a plotly scatter of the cluster centroids labelled with 'Task Name summary'. As before, remember to use a list comprehensions to access the x and y value in each centroid vector.  |

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: 1. Use pandas to read the excel file at /home/oliver/ChatDev/tools_data.xlsx
2. the first three columns are Task Name, Name, Link. Discard other columns.
3. Name the pandas object 'Data_pd' and sav it to file 'Data_pd.parquet'
4. Use the Sentence Transformers package and the "BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5" model to get embeddings of the 'Task Name' column from the pandas . This model is already available to you in the environment. 
5. Add the embeddings column to the pandas dataframe 'Data_pd', now we have columns for Link, Task Name and Embedding. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'.
6. Cluster those embeddings using 20 clusters in K-means. 
7. Update the pandas dataframe 'Data_pd' with each row's cluster assignment. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'.
8. Now that you have clusters, use Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to reduce the embedding dimensions 2. Save those 'reduced_embeddings' to pandas 'Data_pd'. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'.
9. Display a plotly scatter of the 'reduced embeddings'. Remember to use a list comprehension to extract the x and y value from each vector in the 'reduced embedding' column. Also, color=cluster label.
10. Find the centroid of each cluster. Creat a new pandas dataframe 'Clusters_pd', one row per cluster label. Add cluster centroids to the pandas dataframe 'Clusters_pd'. Save 'Clusters_pd' to file 'Cluster_pd.parquet'.
11. Find the 10 embeddings closest to each cluster's centroid, use the two pandas dataframes; 'Data_pd' for embeddings and 'Cluster_pd' for embedding centroids. This will require creating a new pandas dataframe, 'Closest_pd'. Save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'.
12. Create lists of the 'Task Name' for each batch of those 10 embeddings, each batch representing one cluster. Add these to 'Closest_pd'. Hint: as you add 10 'Task Names' for each cluster to 'Closest_pd', use the pd.concat() function to append to 'Closest_pd'. Finally, save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'.
13. Create a prompt for OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo and, for each cluster in 'Closest_pd', submit the list of 10 'Task Names' to the model and ask the model for a summary in 8 words. Repeat this for each cluster. The model will return a 'Task Name summary', one for each cluster.  Record these in the pandas dataframe 'Cluster_pd'. Save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'. Save 'Cluster_pd' to file 'Cluster_pd.parquet'.
14. Display a table of 'Cluster_pd'; 'Cluster label', 'Task Name summary', 'reduced_embedding' and merge the dataframe with a count of records per cluster from 'Data_pd'.
15. Using 'Cluster_pd', Display a plotly scatter of the cluster centroids labelled with 'Task Name summary'. As before, remember to use a list comprehensions to access the x and y value in each centroid vector..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Counselor. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include asking what user and customer think and provide your valuable suggestions. 
Here is a new customer's task: 1. Use pandas to read the excel file at /home/oliver/ChatDev/tools_data.xlsx
2. the first three columns are Task Name, Name, Link. Discard other columns.
3. Name the pandas object 'Data_pd' and sav it to file 'Data_pd.parquet'
4. Use the Sentence Transformers package and the "BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5" model to get embeddings of the 'Task Name' column from the pandas . This model is already available to you in the environment. 
5. Add the embeddings column to the pandas dataframe 'Data_pd', now we have columns for Link, Task Name and Embedding. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'.
6. Cluster those embeddings using 20 clusters in K-means. 
7. Update the pandas dataframe 'Data_pd' with each row's cluster assignment. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'.
8. Now that you have clusters, use Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to reduce the embedding dimensions 2. Save those 'reduced_embeddings' to pandas 'Data_pd'. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'.
9. Display a plotly scatter of the 'reduced embeddings'. Remember to use a list comprehension to extract the x and y value from each vector in the 'reduced embedding' column. Also, color=cluster label.
10. Find the centroid of each cluster. Creat a new pandas dataframe 'Clusters_pd', one row per cluster label. Add cluster centroids to the pandas dataframe 'Clusters_pd'. Save 'Clusters_pd' to file 'Cluster_pd.parquet'.
11. Find the 10 embeddings closest to each cluster's centroid, use the two pandas dataframes; 'Data_pd' for embeddings and 'Cluster_pd' for embedding centroids. This will require creating a new pandas dataframe, 'Closest_pd'. Save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'.
12. Create lists of the 'Task Name' for each batch of those 10 embeddings, each batch representing one cluster. Add these to 'Closest_pd'. Hint: as you add 10 'Task Names' for each cluster to 'Closest_pd', use the pd.concat() function to append to 'Closest_pd'. Finally, save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'.
13. Create a prompt for OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo and, for each cluster in 'Closest_pd', submit the list of 10 'Task Names' to the model and ask the model for a summary in 8 words. Repeat this for each cluster. The model will return a 'Task Name summary', one for each cluster.  Record these in the pandas dataframe 'Cluster_pd'. Save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'. Save 'Cluster_pd' to file 'Cluster_pd.parquet'.
14. Display a table of 'Cluster_pd'; 'Cluster label', 'Task Name summary', 'reduced_embedding' and merge the dataframe with a count of records per cluster from 'Data_pd'.
15. Using 'Cluster_pd', Display a plotly scatter of the cluster centroids labelled with 'Task Name summary'. As before, remember to use a list comprehensions to access the x and y value in each centroid vector..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

For example: manual.md ``` LangChain Building applications with LLMs through composability Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: 1. Use pandas to read the excel file at /home/oliver/ChatDev/tools_data.xlsx
2. the first three columns are Task Name, Name, Link. Discard other columns.
3. Name the pandas object 'Data_pd' and sav it to file 'Data_pd.parquet'
4. Use the Sentence Transformers package and the "BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5" model to get embeddings of the 'Task Name' column from the pandas . This model is already available to you in the environment. 
5. Add the embeddings column to the pandas dataframe 'Data_pd', now we have columns for Link, Task Name and Embedding. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'.
6. Cluster those embeddings using 20 clusters in K-means. 
7. Update the pandas dataframe 'Data_pd' with each row's cluster assignment. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'.
8. Now that you have clusters, use Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to reduce the embedding dimensions 2. Save those 'reduced_embeddings' to pandas 'Data_pd'. Save 'Data_pd' to file 'Data_pd.parquet'.
9. Display a plotly scatter of the 'reduced embeddings'. Remember to use a list comprehension to extract the x and y value from each vector in the 'reduced embedding' column. Also, color=cluster label.
10. Find the centroid of each cluster. Creat a new pandas dataframe 'Clusters_pd', one row per cluster label. Add cluster centroids to the pandas dataframe 'Clusters_pd'. Save 'Clusters_pd' to file 'Cluster_pd.parquet'.
11. Find the 10 embeddings closest to each cluster's centroid, use the two pandas dataframes; 'Data_pd' for embeddings and 'Cluster_pd' for embedding centroids. This will require creating a new pandas dataframe, 'Closest_pd'. Save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'.
12. Create lists of the 'Task Name' for each batch of those 10 embeddings, each batch representing one cluster. Add these to 'Closest_pd'. Hint: as you add 10 'Task Names' for each cluster to 'Closest_pd', use the pd.concat() function to append to 'Closest_pd'. Finally, save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'.
13. Create a prompt for OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo and, for each cluster in 'Closest_pd', submit the list of 10 'Task Names' to the model and ask the model for a summary in 8 words. Repeat this for each cluster. The model will return a 'Task Name summary', one for each cluster.  Record these in the pandas dataframe 'Cluster_pd'. Save 'Closest_pd' to file 'Closest_pd.parquet'. Save 'Cluster_pd' to file 'Cluster_pd.parquet'.
14. Display a table of 'Cluster_pd'; 'Cluster label', 'Task Name summary', 'reduced_embedding' and merge the dataframe with a count of records per cluster from 'Data_pd'.
15. Using 'Cluster_pd', Display a plotly scatter of the cluster centroids labelled with 'Task Name summary'. As before, remember to use a list comprehensions to access the x and y value in each centroid vector..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

# User Manual

## Introduction

This software is designed to perform a series of tasks involving data manipulation, machine learning, and natural language processing. The main functionalities include reading data from an Excel file, performing text embedding, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and interaction with the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, you need to have Python installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once Python is installed, you can install the necessary libraries using pip, which is a package manager for Python. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory. Then, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will install all the necessary libraries listed in the requirements.txt file.

## Usage

To run the software, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will execute the main.py script, which calls all the necessary functions to accomplish the tasks.

The software performs the following tasks:

1. Reads an Excel file and discards all columns except the first three.
2. Uses the Sentence Transformers package to get embeddings of the 'Task Name' column.
3. Clusters the embeddings using K-means.
4. Uses Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to reduce the embedding dimensions.
5. Displays a scatter plot of the reduced embeddings.
6. Finds the centroid of each cluster.
7. Finds the 10 embeddings closest to each cluster's centroid.
8. Creates lists of the 'Task Name' for each batch of those 10 embeddings.
9. Uses OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo to get a summary of the task names.
10. Displays a table of the clusters.
11. Displays a scatter plot of the cluster centroids.

Please note that you need to have the OpenAI API key to use the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model. You can get the API key from the OpenAI website: https://www.openai.com/

Once you have the API key, you can set it in your environment variables using the following command:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

Replace 'your-api-key' with your actual API key.

## Conclusion

This software is a powerful tool for data manipulation, machine learning, and natural language processing tasks. It provides an easy-to-use interface for performing complex tasks. If you have any questions or issues, please feel free to contact us.
